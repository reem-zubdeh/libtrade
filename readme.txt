Considering I greatly exceeded the number of required API's when planning for this project, I will be removing some features from the app. I would have loved to implement the original app I had in mind but will have to stick to the minimum requirements due to time constraints.

I will keep the unused backend files that have to do with the extra features, since they are complete and fully tested. They will be in a separate folder, "unused API".

I hope you will enjoy the project regardless!
